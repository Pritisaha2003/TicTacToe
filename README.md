# TicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java using both core logic and a graphical user interface (GUI)

In this project, I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java using both core logic and a graphical user interface (GUI). I created two main classes: Main to initialize the game and TicTacToe to handle gameplay. The game alternates between players, checks for wins, and updates the display. I used JFrame for the window and GridLayout for the 3x3 grid of buttons. Each button was linked to action listeners for player moves, providing an interactive and functional game.
